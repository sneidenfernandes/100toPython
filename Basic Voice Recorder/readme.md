In this mini project, I've implemented a basic audio recorder in Python. I've used the wavio and sounddevice libraries to accomplish this in addition to using 
the progress bar that I've previously used written. It has been modified to show time instead of download size. 

This project has been inspired by www.geeksforgeeks.org.
