## Word Frequency Counter

This Python mini project is a Word Frequency counter that analyses the frequency of each word in a given  text file. It can be used to gain insights into the most commonly used words used within the text.
As an example, the program has been used to analyse Haruki Murakami's 
short story 'Cream'.
