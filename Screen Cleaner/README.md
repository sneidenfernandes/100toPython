## Screen Cleaner

This Python script automates the deletion of screenshot files from your desktop. It scans your desktop directory for filenames containing "screenshot" (case-insensitive) and removes them permanently. Please use this script with caution and ensure you have a backup of important files before running it.

### Usage

1. Save the script file (`screencleaner.py`) to the desired location.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the folder containing the script.
4. Run the script using the command: `python screenshotcleaner.py`

### Important Note

- This script irreversibly deletes files with "screenshot" in their filenames from your desktop.
- Make sure to understand the code before running it to avoid unintended data loss.

### Disclaimer

Use this script at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any data loss or damage caused by the use of this script.
