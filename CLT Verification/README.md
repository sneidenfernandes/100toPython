Central Limit Theorem Verification

This Python program demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through a simulation. The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean of a large enough number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution.
