## 100toPython: Rediscovering Python through 100 Mini Projects

Life can get in the way of whats important to you sometimes, and getting back into the groove can be a bit daunting. This repository was born out of a personal desire and need to reconnect with the joy of coding in Python. By breaking down the journey into 100 mini projects, the aim is to make the process more manageable, engaging, and rewarding. My goal is to re-learn python through application instead of relying on theoretical courses and excercises.
