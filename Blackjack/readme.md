I wrrote a Python Blackjack program inspired by the book "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" by Al Sweigart.
This engaging project allows players to enjoy the classic casino card game right on their computer.
It features a user-friendly interface and follows the standard rules of Blackjack, including the options to hit, stand, and double down.
